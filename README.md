#Spring snow in the garden 
The northern scenery, thousands of miles of ice, and thousands of miles of snow.

Looking inside and outside the the Great Wall, there is nothing more than luxuriant.

The mountains and silver snakes, the original wax figure, want to compare with the heavenly king.

Must be sunny day, see red and white, enchanting.

The rivers and mountains are so charming that they bring countless heroes to the waist.

Pity Qin Emperor Han Wu, slightly lose literary grace; Tang Zong Song Zu, slightly less coquettish.

Gen Gi Khan, a generation of arrogant, knows only the bow and shoot the big eagle.

All are past and gone; we look to this age for truly great men.
